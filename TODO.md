# TODOs

Basics:
- Eradication / game over / level won
- Enemy AI!!!
  - Defensive: just keeps all units around, but attacks those attacking it
  - Stupid: sends all new units to attack nearest non-self base immediately
  - Strategic: builds a small army first, then attacks neutral bases in order to capture
      - leaves some behind to defend
      - if army is dying, will attempt to flee
      - if base under attack, will redirect units to defend

Important:
- Morale system
  - Defection
  - Moral decay

Levels:
- Level1 (only a neutral base)
- Level2 (enemy base and neutral base)
- Level3 (multiple enemy bases and neutral bases)

Polish:
- Base health bar
- Level reset button / key? (Or pause menu)
- UI for Unit / base counts for each player
- Death animation
- Spawn animation
- Attack particle effect
- Unit trail animation
- Base capture color animation
- Base capture "swoosh" effect
- Background space particles
- Bloom effect
- Background music
- Sound effects
- Camera edge scrolling
- Title screen
- Max units (based on # of total bases, I guess)
- Have laser ray-cast to the surface of the bases
- Collision avoidance
- Allow selecting bases and sending their units somewhere
- Level transitions

Extras:
- Towers
- Tower capture
- Tower attacks
  - AOE?
- More unit / base types!
