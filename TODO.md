# TODOs

Next:
- Enemy AI!!!!!!
  - Defensive: just keeps all units around, but attacks those attacking it
  - Stupid: sends all new units to attack nearest non-self base immediately
  - Strategic: builds a small army first, then attacks neutral bases in order to capture
      - leaves some behind to defend
      - if army is dying, will attempt to flee
      - if base under attack, will redirect units to defend
- Playtest / balance
- Create itch.io page

Polish:
- Cursor animation
- Bloom effect
- Death animation
- Attack particle effect
- Attack / death sound effects
- Base capture color animation
- Base capture "swoosh" effect
- Base capture sound effect
- Fear system / fleeing?
- Background space particles
- Buildup-guage based way of base takeover?

Cutting block:
- UI for Unit / base counts for each player
- Collision avoidance
- Improved "arrival" logic
- Camera edge scrolling
- Max units (based on # of total bases, I guess)
- Scoring system? :O
- Save data + level selector?
- Spawn animation

Bugs:
- Fix motion jankiness when becoming defector
- HP bar is sometimes below units

Extras:
- Towers
- Tower capture
- Tower attacks
  - AOE?
- More unit / base types!
